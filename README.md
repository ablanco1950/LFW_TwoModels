# LFW_TwoModels
A recognition process of images contained in the LFW database http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/#download is carried out using two models, one based on the minimum distance between training image records and test and another that is an adaptation of the CNN KERAS model https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/. Both models are complementary.
